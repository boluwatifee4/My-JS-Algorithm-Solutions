Data structures is a collection of values , algorithms are the steps we put into place to manipulate these collections of values.

What is a data strucres

Operations on Data Structures

1. Insertion: Add a new data element to the data structure
2. Deletion: Remove a data element from the data structure
3. Traversal: Visiting all the data elements in the data structure once so that it can be processed
4. Searching: Find the location of a data element in the data structure
5. Sorting: Arrange the data elements in a specific order
6. Access: Retrieve the value of a data element from the data structure (Most important operation probably)
