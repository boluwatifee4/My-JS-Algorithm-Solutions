# My-JS-Algorithm-Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various JavaScript algorithms problems sourced from platforms like HackerRank and other online resources. The goal is to practice and improve my problem-solving skills in JavaScript.
```

## Introduction

This repository, `My-JS-Algorithm-Solutions`, houses my solutions to various JavaScript algorithm challenges sourced from platforms like HackerRank and other online resources. The primary goal is to provide working code examples and demonstrate problem-solving approaches in JavaScript. Key features include:

*   Solutions to a wide range of algorithm problems.
*   Code written in JavaScript.
*   Clear and concise code with comments for understanding.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/My-JS-Algorithm-Solutions.git
    ```
    Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username if you are cloning your own fork.

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd My-JS-Algorithm-Solutions
    ```

3.  **(Optional) Install Node.js and npm (if you don't have them):**
    If you don't have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed, you'll need to install them. You can download them from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).  This is generally required for running and testing the JavaScript code.

4.  **(Optional) Install dependencies:**
    If the project uses any external libraries (which is unlikely for simple algorithm solutions, but included for completeness), you would install them using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    This command will read the `package.json` file (if it exists) and install the necessary dependencies.

Now you are ready to explore and run the JavaScript algorithm solutions!

## Usage

This repository contains solutions to various JavaScript algorithm problems. Here are a few examples of how to use the code:

**1. Finding Common Items in Arrays (exercise1.js)**

This example demonstrates how to determine if two arrays share any common elements.

```javascript
// Example Usage
const array1 = ["a", "b", "c", "x"];
const array2 = ["z", "y", "i", "x"];
const hasCommonItems = // (Implementation from exercise1.js)
console.log(hasCommonItems(array1, array2)); // Output: true
```

**2. FizzBuzz (fizzbuzz.js)**

This classic problem involves iterating through numbers and printing "Fizz", "Buzz", or "FizzBuzz" based on divisibility.

```javascript
// Example Usage (Assuming a function named fizzBuzz is defined)
function fizzBuzz(n) {
  // Implementation from fizzbuzz.js
}

fizzBuzz(15); // Output: 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz
```

**3. Baseball Game (int.js)**

This example addresses a baseball game scoring problem with specific rules.

```javascript
// Example Usage (Assuming a function named calculateScore is defined)
function calculateScore(ops) {
  // Implementation from int.js
}

const ops = ["5", "2", "C", "D", "+"];
const score = calculateScore(ops);
console.log(score); // Output: 30 (Example output, depends on the implementation)
```

**4. Finding the Most Frequent Character (maxChr.js)**

This example shows how to find the most frequently occurring character in a string.

```javascript
// Example Usage (Assuming a function named maxChar is defined)
function maxChar(str) {
  // Implementation from maxChr.js
}

console.log(maxChar("abcccccccd")); // Output: c
console.log(maxChar("apple 1231111")); // Output: 1
```
